explain some specifics about this infrastructure:

    For every additional element, why you are adding it
- To increase redundancy reducing potential ares of spof
- To ease scalability
    What are firewalls for
- Security
    Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
- To encrypt data being sent over the network for security
    What monitoring is used for
- To provide feedback and measure efficiency among other things and report potential flaws
    How the monitoring tool is collecting data
    Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
QPS means queries per second
You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:

    Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue. With direct access to the server, it is unsafe
    Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
in case of corruption or failure the database data may be lost
    Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem
- potential flaw in design will be tiring to fix
- Security issue means the whole system is compromised
